# Journal 01

## Monday, 2019-08-26
Putting together curriculum ahead of time is not ideal process for me, I've found. I think a more fluid approach would work better. Take a top down approach with Fast.ai and supplement with bottom up ad-hoc lessons as needed.

My starting point: CS degree; professional web, C#, SQL developer; a few recent college AI courses and MOOCs; interest in brain and tech.
### Resources
  - Fast.ai
    - https://course.fast.ai/
    - took 2018 course part 1 and 2; 2019 is better good and newer
  - Google Cloud Platform
    - https://cloud.google.com/
    - 300 free hours of cloud computing
    - see [gcp setup](https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html)
  - The Math of Intelligence
    - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D
    - potentially good math / ai review

I'm trying new journal headings. Might be getting little carried away by amount of detail. Probably not useful. I'm taking notes not writing a book.

Research suggests hand-written notes aid memory more than typing but text is searchable. Hmmm.
### Log
- Using Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop (GNOME 3)
- Ubuntu startup in VirtualBox would display error "drm:vmn_host_log [vmugfx] ERROR Failed to send log message"; fix was to change grafphic controller from VMSVGA to VBoxVGA in VM's settings > display
- Installed Atom deb and Markdown-Preview-Plus package for journaling. Still using VIM when with terminal.
- VirtualBox 6.0 with Ubuntu 18.04 guest on external USB 3 SSD runs fine between MacOS High Sierra and Windows 10 1903; as long as guest is shut down, saved state on Win can't restart on Mac, probably other direction as well. Looking at saving application state on shutdown to restore on restart.
- Reading Stanford CS231n Module 1 Neural Networks; good refresher and they use some different terminology; like volume instead of tensor (not sure if old or new and in what context)
- Entire system slowed down. 10 Chrome tabs open, several running processes; Switched to Firefox for comparison.
- Mac captures Super key (command); Windows passes it through. I.e. More Ubuntu shortcuts available with Windows host.
### Resources
  - Stanford CS231 Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition

    - Fast.ai lesson 1 recommended [CNN Primer](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
  - Glossary of Artificial Intelligence
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_artificial_intelligence
### Terminology
  - input: training setup
  - learning: training a classifier or learning a model
  - evaluation: compare true answers, true labels, ground truth to predicted
  - toy dataset: for learning, experimentation, not substantial by today's standards
