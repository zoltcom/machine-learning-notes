"representation learning","use machine learning to discover representation as well as the mapping from representation; e.g. cartesian v. polar coordinates"
"autoencoder","combination of encoder and decoder"
"encoder","converts input data into different representation"
"decoder","converts encoded representation back into original input format"
"factors of variation","concepts or abstractions that help make sense of the rich variability in the data; e.g. a car's position, color, reflections and lighting"
"disentangle","separate factors of variation and discard unimportant ones"
