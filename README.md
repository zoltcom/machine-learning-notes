# machine-learning-notes
For my learning, experimenting, and reference

## audience
Just me. Feel free to browse around but my goal is to learn as effectively as possible and not to create a general-purpose tutorial for others. It is an explicit goal to not spend time documenting or formatting.

## reference
- Python - Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney
- PyTorch - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
- Fastai - https://www.fast.ai/

## license
There is no license for what I generate but I may use material from books or other sources as a starting point. I'll include their licenses where applicable.
